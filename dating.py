# This program asks the user if they are
# good looking and if they are rich.
# If they are either good looking or rich,
# then the program will tell the user that
# they are eligible to date my grandchild.
# The program will also tell the user if
# their response is invalid, which is anything
# other than "1" (for yes) or "0" (for no).


# this function checks to see if the user
# is either rich or good looking, and displays
# the results back to the user. This function also
# checks to make sure the user input is valid.
